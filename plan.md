## Project Plan for Scheduling AI Application

**I. Project Goals**

The primary goal is to create a scheduling application that allows a supervisor to:

1.  Edit employee schedules.
2.  Connect to an AI model (Ollama) for schedule analysis and suggestions.
3.  Receive AI-powered insights and recommendations for optimizing the schedule.

**II. Current Status**

Based on the file analysis, the following functionality is already implemented:

*   **Backend (Flask):**
    *   User authentication (login, JWT).
    *   Employee management (CRUD operations, access roles).
    *   Shift management (CRUD operations, validation).
    *   Ollama integration (API endpoints for querying Ollama).
    *   Basic RAG implementation for context retrieval.
    *   Database models for employees, schedules, and Ollama queries.
*   **Frontend (React):**
    *   Routing and navigation.
    *   Login page and protected routes.
    *   Components for schedule calendar, employee management, and Ollama assistant.
    *   Basic UI for interacting with the backend.

**III. Missing Functionality**

The following functionality needs to be implemented:

*   **Supervisor Interface:**
    *   A user-friendly interface for supervisors to view and edit employee schedules.
    *   Drag-and-drop functionality for assigning shifts to employees.
    *   Ability to create, update, and delete shifts.
*   **Enhanced AI Integration:**
    *   Improved RAG implementation for more accurate context retrieval.
    *   More sophisticated prompt engineering for better AI responses.
    *   Ability to specify scheduling constraints and receive AI-powered suggestions.
    *   Integration with the supervisor interface to display AI insights and recommendations.
*   **Data Visualization:**
    *   Visualizations to display schedule data, such as employee availability, shift coverage, and workload distribution.
    *   Charts and graphs to highlight potential scheduling conflicts and areas for improvement.
*   **Testing and Error Handling:**
    *   Comprehensive unit and integration tests for backend and frontend components.
    *   Robust error handling and logging to ensure application stability.
*   **Deployment:**
    *   Deployment scripts and instructions for deploying the application to a production environment.

**IV. Project Plan**

The project will be completed in the following stages:

**Stage 1: Supervisor Interface Development**

1.  **Implement the schedule editing interface:**
    *   Create React components for displaying and editing the schedule.
    *   Implement drag-and-drop functionality for assigning shifts to employees.
    *   Implement forms for creating, updating, and deleting shifts.
2.  **Integrate the interface with the backend:**
    *   Connect the frontend components to the backend API endpoints for shift management.
    *   Implement data validation and error handling.
3.  **Implement role-based access control:**
    *   Ensure that only supervisors can access the schedule editing interface.

**Stage 2: Enhanced AI Integration**

1.  **Improve the RAG implementation:**
    *   Implement more sophisticated techniques for extracting relevant information from the database.
    *   Use natural language processing (NLP) techniques to better understand user queries.
2.  **Refine the prompt engineering:**
    *   Experiment with different prompts to optimize the AI's responses.
    *   Incorporate scheduling constraints into the prompts.
3.  **Integrate AI suggestions into the supervisor interface:**
    *   Display AI-powered insights and recommendations in the schedule editing interface.
    *   Allow supervisors to easily apply AI suggestions to the schedule.

**Stage 3: Data Visualization**

1.  **Implement data visualizations:**
    *   Create charts and graphs to display schedule data, such as employee availability, shift coverage, and workload distribution.
    *   Use libraries such as Chart.js or D3.js to create interactive visualizations.
2.  **Integrate visualizations into the supervisor interface:**
    *   Display the visualizations in the schedule editing interface.
    *   Allow supervisors to filter and customize the visualizations.

**Stage 4: Testing and Error Handling**

1.  **Write unit and integration tests:**
    *   Create comprehensive tests for backend and frontend components.
    *   Use testing frameworks such as Jest and pytest.
2.  **Implement error handling and logging:**
    *   Add error handling to all API endpoints and frontend components.
    *   Use a logging library to track application events and errors.

**Stage 5: Deployment**

1.  **Create deployment scripts:**
    *   Automate the deployment process using scripts.
    *   Use tools such as Docker and Ansible.
2.  **Write deployment instructions:**
    *   Provide clear and concise instructions for deploying the application to a production environment.

**V. Technologies**

*   Frontend: React, JavaScript, HTML, CSS
*   Backend: Flask, Python
*   Database: PostgreSQL
*   AI: Ollama
*   Testing: Jest, pytest
*   Deployment: Docker, Ansible

**VI. Timeline**

The project is estimated to take 4-6 weeks to complete.

**VII. Employee Preference Data Model Design**

1.  **Identify Key Preferences:** The employee preferences to be included are: preferred shifts, preferred days, days off, maximum hours, and maximum shifts in a row.
2.  **Data Structure:** The following columns will be added to the `Employee` model:
    *   `preferred_shifts`: A list of preferred shift times (e.g., ["morning", "afternoon", "evening"]).
    *   `preferred_days`: A list of preferred days of the week (e.g., ["Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday"]).
    *   `days_off`: A list of specific dates the employee wants off (e.g., ["2025-04-20", "2025-05-01"]).
    *   `max_hours`: An integer representing the maximum number of hours the employee can work per week.
    *   `max_shifts_in_a_row`: An integer representing the maximum number of consecutive shifts the employee can work.
3.  **Storage Location:** Employee preference data will be stored within the `Employee` model in the database.
4.  **Backend Implementation:**
    *   Modify the backend API to allow supervisors to set and update employee preferences via the existing employee management endpoints.
    *   Ensure the API endpoints retrieve and return the new preference fields.
5.  **Frontend Integration:**
    *   Develop UI components for supervisors to manage employee preferences within the existing employee management interface.
    *   Integrate these components with the backend API.

**VIII. AI Integration**

1.  **Preference Incorporation:** Modify the RAG implementation and prompt engineering to incorporate employee preferences when generating schedule suggestions.
2.  **Constraint Handling:** Ensure the AI model respects employee preferences as constraints when creating schedules.
3.  **Evaluation:** Evaluate the impact of employee preferences on schedule quality and fairness.

**IX. Implementation Steps**

1.  **Database Model:** Modify the `Employee` model in `backend/models.py` to add the new preference fields.
2.  **API Endpoints:** Modify the API endpoints in `backend/routes/employee.py` to handle the new preference fields.
3.  **Frontend Components:** Develop React components in `frontend/src/components/` for managing preferences within the employee management interface.
4.  **AI Integration:** Modify the RAG and prompt engineering logic in `backend/utils/ai_utils.py` (or similar) to incorporate preferences.
5.  **Testing:** Write unit tests for the backend and frontend components.
